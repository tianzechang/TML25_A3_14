# TML25 Assignment 3 – Robustness

This repository contains the code and model for Assignment 3 of the **Trustworthy Machine Learning (SS 2025)** course.  
The task is to train a robust image classifier that performs well on both clean and adversarial examples (FGSM and PGD).

## Files

- `main.py`  
  Trains a robust ResNet classifier on the provided dataset using PGD or FGSM adversarial training.  
  The script exports `.pt` model files compatible with the evaluation server.

- `submission.py`  
  Used to locally validate and submit the exported model to the evaluation server.  
  Includes basic checks for model architecture and output shape.

- `report.pdf`

## Model

- Model type: One of `resnet18`, `resnet34`, or `resnet50` (default: `resnet34`)
- Input shape: **3×32×32**
- Output: **10 classes**

## Output

- The training script (`main.py`) saves model checkpoints as `.pt` files .
